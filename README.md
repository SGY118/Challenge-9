# Challenge-9
## Purpose
We want to help Avry to open new shops in Oahu, Hawaii. However he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Therefor we need to help him to make decisions using the data we analyzed.
## Result
- Maximum temperature in June can reach to 85F
- Maximum temperature in December can reach to 83F
- The minimum temperature in both months result in a 3F difference
## Summary
From the results above, we could not identify which store to open during each months, because there is a relative small difference between the maximum and minimum temperature. Therefore, we need to perform two extra queries in order to help Avry to decide which store to open. We could run queries to analyze sunny and rainy days for these two months. If June rains more, then tourists might not want to surf but stay indoor and get icecreams. Running both June and December sunny and rainy days will solve Avry's business dilemma and hopefully helping him to make the decision.
